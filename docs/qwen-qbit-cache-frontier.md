# Qwen QBit Cache Frontier

Document status: measured-experimental

Current frontier: CPU diagnostic for Gaussian Lloyd-Max prefix compression of
recurrent Qwen cache state at 8, 7, and 6 retained bit planes.

Bounded context: local `.qkv` state artifacts. ClickHouse storage and background
part merges are a separate transport/storage context.

## Admitted surface

- A default-off probe may encode recurrent Float32 records in independent
  affine blocks, quantize normalized values with the 256-level Gaussian
  Lloyd-Max quantizer, retain the most-significant 8, 7, or 6 code planes, and
  reconstruct each prefix with its Gaussian conditional mean.
- The probe may report payload size, CPU encode/decode time, next-token logit
  error, and free-running token parity on a local model.
- Eight-plane reconstruction is the full-code reference. It is not lossless
  relative to the original Float32 state.

## Rejected surface

- No production prompt-cache codec, artifact version, manifest value, default,
  or compatibility promise is added in this slice.
- No claim that scalar MSE implies autoregressive parity.
- No claim that ClickHouse background merges are on the cache-hit critical
  path: newly inserted rows must remain readable before a part merge completes.
- No Metal/CUDA decoder or end-to-end ClickHouse Native writer yet. Per-tile
  plane bytes do have a checked `QBit(Int8, 8)` ordering contract.

## Guard-only future

- A versioned recurrent QBit artifact codec with direct device decode.
- ClickHouse storage using fixed-size tiles and independently readable bit
  planes.
- Progressive fetch or fallback from 6/7 planes to the full 8-plane code.

## Design laws

- Persist block mean and standard deviation; fail closed on non-finite input.
- Pack planes most-significant first and keep the format deterministic.
- Compare 6/7 planes against the 8-plane quantized reference and against the
  current BF16/INT8 cache routes; do not compare only with raw Float32 size.
- Treat token/logit parity and end-to-end cold-hit latency as the value. Payload
  bytes and scalar MSE are supporting proxies.

## Falsifier roster

- Known Gaussian cells reconstruct symmetrically and share one centroid within
  each retained prefix.
- Payload sizes equal the declared block layout for full and tail blocks.
- On deterministic Gaussian-like data, MSE must not increase when precision is
  widened from 6 to 7 to 8 planes.
- On real cache state, report first token divergence and continuation parity;
  any divergence keeps the precision experimental.
- A later ClickHouse gate must measure insert visibility separately from
  background merge duration and full cold-hit restore latency.

## Stop rules

- Stop widening the artifact format if the pure codec does not survive the
  deterministic tests.
- Do not implement a device decoder until at least one real-model row shows a
  useful size/parity trade-off.
- Do not attribute cache latency to ClickHouse merges unless a measured read is
  actually blocked on a merge.

## Measured evidence (2026-08-14)

All model rows used the embedded chat renderer, greedy continuation, recurrent
block size 1024, and exact ClickHouse p6/p7 centroid bit patterns. Payload sizes
include raw KV records but exclude a future QBit artifact envelope.

| Model / prompt gate | Codec | Bytes | Raw ratio | Existing INT8 delta | Free run | Teacher forced |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Qwen3.5 9B, sky, 32 tokens | p7 | 20,017,664 | 32.77% | -7.39% | 32/32 | 31/31 |
| Qwen3.5 9B, sky, 32 tokens | p6 | 18,371,072 | 30.08% | -15.01% | 1/32 | 29/31 |
| Qwen3.8 27B, sky, 16 tokens | p7 | 51,404,032 | 29.60% | -8.46% | 16/16 | 15/15 |
| Qwen3.8 27B, sky, 16 tokens | p6 | 46,501,120 | 26.78% | -17.19% | 16/16 | 15/15 |

The 9B p7 gate also preserved 32/32 free-running and 31/31 teacher-forced
top-1 tokens on JSON and Python prompts. The 9B p6 counterexample means p6 is
not near-lossless and cannot be promoted from this evidence. P7 is the first
candidate for a wider prompt/cursor matrix.

The current scalar CPU implementation is a negative latency result. On Qwen3.8
27B, p7 encode/decode took 2,398/1,191 ms, followed by 13 ms raw Float32
restore. The current recurrent INT8 artifact encoded in 248 ms. A direct Metal
plane decoder is therefore a prerequisite; the CPU route must not enter the
cache-hit path.

### ClickHouse boundary probe

Local ClickHouse 26.8.1.1 on the Apple M2 Max was tested with incompressible
`String CODEC(NONE)` payloads to isolate part movement from QBit quality:

- a 50 MiB part inserted in 42-48 ms;
- reading and hashing one 50 MiB row took 22-23 ms with the filesystem cache
  warm;
- `OPTIMIZE FINAL` merged eight 8 MiB parts (64 MiB) in 98 ms;
- `OPTIMIZE FINAL` merged eight 50 MiB parts (400 MiB) in 649 ms.

These are local forced-merge throughput probes, not a server scheduling SLA. An
inserted row was visible while eight parts still existed, so a background merge
is not part of cache-hit latency. On this host the measured 50 MiB read was
roughly 50 times shorter than scalar p7 decode.

A second probe used the intended tile shape directly: one row per 1024 codes in
`QBit(Int8, 1024)`, 8192 tiles per inserted part, and eight active parts. Random
full p8 codes occupied 64.51 MiB and merged in 150 ms. Clearing the code LSB to
represent p7 made the eighth plane all-zero; ClickHouse compressed the eight
parts to 56.51 MiB, merged them in 104 ms, and read+hashed the seven retained
plane subcolumns in 27 ms. This validates the compact physical direction and
selective-plane read path.

The SQL insertion route is a negative result: constructing arrays and casting
them to QBit took 116-156 ms per 8 MiB logical part because ClickHouse had to
transpose the codes. Cogni-ml already produces bytes in
`SerializationQBit::transposeBits` order, so the integration must send the
pre-transposed Native QBit streams instead of paying that conversion. This
wire-level path remains unimplemented and must be benchmarked before promotion.

Production storage should batch all tiles for one or more cache keys per insert
to avoid part-count pressure. Background merges should perform cleanup and
compaction, never admission or visibility.

### Cache-engine contract

- Make cache keys content-addressed over model, tokenizer/chat-template,
  engine/state ABI, prompt tokens, cache policy, and artifact codec version.
- Insert every tile of one artifact in one batch and persist expected tile
  count plus an artifact digest. Restore fails closed on missing, duplicate, or
  mismatched tiles; it never waits for `FINAL` or a merge.
- Store recurrent state as 1024-code QBit tiles with per-tile mean, sigma, value
  count, record kind, layer, and tile ordinal. Keep live KV chunks separately
  because their length follows the cached sequence rather than the recurrent
  tile grid.
- Filter expiration at read time. TTL merges reclaim space asynchronously and
  are not an authority for whether a stale row is admissible.
- Send pre-transposed Native streams and read only retained plane subcolumns.
  SQL Array-to-QBit casts remain a diagnostic fallback, not the serving route.
