# Qwen-Image 2.1 GGUF Frontier

Status: active implementation frontier (2026-09-21)

## Goal

Admit Qwen-Image 2.1 weights into the native Metal engine without treating a
file name such as `Q4` as evidence of its actual tensor policy.

## Admitted now

- Parse GGUF `qwen_image` metadata without mapping the tensor payload.
- Support GGML BF16 tensor type 30 in byte sizing and CPU dequantization.
- Inventory actual per-tensor quantization types and storage sizes.
- Recover and validate ComfyUI `comfy.gguf.orig_shape.<tensor>` metadata.
- Validate the exact 32-block Qwen-Image 2.1 DiT tensor inventory.
- Report whether every tensor type is readable by the current Cogni-ML GGUF
  dequantization layer.
- Execute a parameterized one-block CPU reference with the upstream 2.1
  equations: affine-less LayerNorm, per-head Q/K RMSNorm, three-axis RoPE,
  block-causal attention, shared tanh modulation gates, and fused SwiGLU.
- Multiply BF16 GGUF matrices directly in the CPU reference path.
- Check the complete tiny block against an independent PyTorch oracle.
- Reject truncated GGUFs before exposing any mmap-backed tensor slice.
- Recover mathematical projection dimensions from Comfy `orig_shape` metadata
  while preserving ordinary GGUF `[in, out]` dimension semantics.
- Load all top-level and 32 transformer-block weights as zero-copy mmap slices,
  with exact per-projection shape validation and explicit mmap lifetime.
- Reuse the Qwen 3.5 Q8/Q5/Q6 Metal projection kernels inside the exact block
  reference. On two real tokens through block 0, the CPU/Metal boundary produced
  `max_abs=1.5258789e-5` and cosine `0.999999999999972` across 8192 outputs.

## Pinned bootstrap artifact

- Repository: `realrebelai/Qwen-Image-2.1_GGUFs`
- Revision: `8d393b750593a72ee040fe7d40611f479ccee679`
- File: `Qwen-Image-2.1-Q4.gguf`
- Bytes: `5959127264`
- SHA-256: `51998ad7c068ce7d68e233237537900ffe874ab4d5c72e20758f5f18ceb15b8a`
- Actual tensor policy: `BF16:8,F32:65,Q8_0:96,Q6_K:64,Q5_K:32`

The repository README describes this policy as its Qwen-specific mixed Q4
release even though its recommended long `Q4_K_M-HQv3` label does not match the
current short filename. The loader trusts the inspected tensor directory, not
either label.

## Not admitted by this slice

- Full 32-block DiT execution, a fully resident Metal block, text encoders,
  VAE, scheduler, or image generation. The admitted Metal parity route moves
  only projection matmuls to Metal; block orchestration and attention remain on
  the CPU.
- A claim that a readable GGUF has acceptable image quality.
- A custom weight format derived from the resident-KV adaptive QBit codec.
- Trusting repository or file labels (`Q4`, `dynamic`, `HQ`) over tensor data.

## Guard and next transition

The next implementation transition is a Metal-native block with resident
intermediates and block-causal attention, followed by all-32-block numerical
checks. Top-level BF16 projections need a batch-capable route before the full
DiT can avoid CPU fallback. Text encoding, sampling, and VAE decode remain
separate frontiers.

The model-backed checks are:

```bash
QWEN_IMAGE21_GGUF=/path/to/Qwen-Image-2.1-Q4.gguf \
  crystal spec spec/qwen_image21_weights_spec.cr spec/qwen_image21_metal_spec.cr \
  --link-flags="$(pwd)/build/bridge.o -framework Metal -framework Foundation -lc++"
```

## Falsifiers

- A real candidate contains an unimplemented tensor type.
- A `comfy.gguf.orig_shape.*` entry changes the tensor element count.
- Any required top-level or per-block tensor is absent, duplicated, or appears
  under an incompatible architecture.
- A full candidate is shorter than the last tensor extent declared in its
  directory.
- Any real block projection lacks a strict Metal route or exceeds the declared
  CPU/Metal tolerance.
- A later image-quality corpus shows that the selected mixed quantization
  policy is worse than its declared baseline.
